# dependent-packages

Offline collection of the dependents and devDependents of every package in the npm registry.

⚠️ HEY ⚠️

This package weighs in at around 450MB!
It's kind of big and takes a while to install,
as it unpacks over 100,000 small JSON files.
For a lightweight alternative that just contains
counts and not the actual dependent package names,
try the [dependent-counts](http://ghub.io/dependent-counts)
module. It's only 7MB.

:v:

## Installation

```sh
npm install npm-dependency-stats --save
```

## Usage

```js
const {directDependents, directDevDependents} = require('dependent-packages')

directDependents('express')
// all package names that have express listed in `dependencies`

directDevDependents('cheerio')
// all package names that have cheerio listed in `devDependencies`
```

```
